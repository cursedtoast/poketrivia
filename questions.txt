	It charges its enemies, lances at the ready. An image of one of its duels is captured in a famous painting of it clashing with Sirfetch’d. ## Escavalier
	It has a strange physiology that responds to electricity. When together with Karrablast, it evolves for some reason. ## Shelmet
	Discarding its shell made it nimble. To keep itself from dehydrating, it wraps its body in bands of membrane. ## Accelgor

	A combative Pokémon, it’s ready to pick a fight with anyone. It has talons that can crush hard berries. ## Rufflet
	Because this Pokémon is hotheaded and belligerent, it’s Corviknight that’s taken the role of transportation in Galar. ## Braviary
	They grow quickly. Bones that have gotten too small for older ones to wear often get passed down to younger ones in the nest. ## Vullaby
	They adorn themselves with bones. There seem to be fashion trends among them, as different bones come into and fall out of popularity. ## Mandibuzz
	It attacks using the claws on its tail. Once locked in its grip, its prey is unable to move as this Pokémon’s poison seeps in. ## Skorupi
	It’s so vicious that it’s called the Sand Demon. Yet when confronted by Hippowdon, it keeps a low profile and will never pick a fight. ## Drapion
	The younger the life this Pokémon absorbs, the brighter and eerier the flame on its head burns. ## Litwick
	It lurks in cities, pretending to be a lamp. Once it finds someone whose death is near, it will trail quietly after them. ## Lampent
	In homes illuminated by this pokemon instead of lights, funerals were a constant occurrence— or so it’s said. ## Chandelure
	By exposing foes to the blinking of its luminescent spots, this pokemon demoralizes them, and then it seizes the chance to flee. ## Inkay
	It’s said that this pokemon's hypnotic powers played a role in certain history-changing events. ## Malamar
	It has a cunning yet savage disposition. It waits for parents to leave their nests, and then it sneaks in to steal their eggs. ## Sneasel

	A discovery was made in the desert where these pokemon fly. The ruins of what may have been an ancient city were found beneath the sands. ## Sigilyph
	It can use waves called auras to gauge how others are feeling. These same waves can also tell this Pokémon about the state of the environment. ## Riolu
	It can tell what people are thinking. Only Trainers who have justice in their hearts can earn this Pokémon’s trust. ## Lucario

	There was a scientist who peeked under Mimikyu’s old rag in the name of research. The scientist died of a mysterious disease. ## Mimikyu

	It manipulates the chemical makeup of its poison to produce electricity. The voltage is weak, but it can cause a tingling paralysis. ## Toxel
	It has an electrical organ on its chest. While generating electricity, it fills its surroundings with what sounds like the strumming of a bass guitar. ## Toxtricity
	This short-tempered and aggressive Pokémon chugs stagnant water to absorb any toxins it might contain. ## Toxtricity
	It spews sand from its nostrils. While the enemy is blinded, it burrows into the ground to hide. ## Silicobra
	Its unique style of coiling allows it to blast sand out of its sand sac more efficiently. ## Sandaconda
	This Pokémon is active during the day and passes the cold desert nights burrowed snugly into the sand. ## Hippopotas

	With their large mandibles, these Pokémon can crunch their way through rock. They work together to protect their eggs from Sandaconda. ## Durant
	A flame serves as its tongue, melting through the hard shell of Durant so that it can devour their insides. ## Heatmor

	They play with each other by knocking their large tusks together. Their tusks break sometimes, but they grow back so quickly that it isn’t a concern. ## Axew
	Its skin is as hard as a suit of armor. Its favorite strategy is to tackle its opponents, stabbing them with its tusks at the same time. ## Fraxure
	While usually kindhearted, it can be terrifying if angered. Tusks that can slice through steel beams are how it deals with its adversaries. ## Haxorus
	It's said that this Pokemon was formed when an ancient clay tablet was drawn to a vengeful spirit. ## Yamask ## Galarian Yamask

	The teacup in which this Pokémon makes its home is a famous piece of antique tableware. Many forgeries are in circulation. ## Sinistea
	Leaving leftover black tea unattended is asking for this Pokémon to come along and pour itself into it, turning the tea into a new one of these pokemon. ## Polteageist

	With a voice like a human child’s, it cries out to lure adults deep into the forest, getting them lost among the trees. ## Phantump
	Small roots that extend from the tips of this Pokémon’s feet can tie into the trees of the forest and give this pokemon control over them. ## Trevenant
	These pokemon live in forests that stay dark even during the day. They scatter flickering spores that put enemies to sleep. ## Morelull
	If you see a light deep in a forest at night, don’t go near. It will make you fall fast asleep. ## Shiinotic
	It knows the forest inside and out. If it comes across a wounded Pokémon, it will gather medicinal herbs to treat it. ## Oranguru
	They live in groups of about 20, with each member performing an assigned role. Through cooperation, the group survives. ## Passimian
	It carries electrically roasted seeds with it as if they’re precious treasures. No matter how much it eats, it always gets hungry again in short order. ## Morpeko
	The six of them work together as one Pokémon. Teamwork is also their battle strategy, and they constantly change their formation as they fight. ## Falinks
	It is a kind and friendly Pokémon—up until it’s angered. When that happens, it stirs up a gale and flattens everything around. ## Drampa
	Eating sulfur in its volcanic habitat is what causes explosive compounds to develop in its shell. Its droppings are also dangerously explosive. ## Turtonator
	When it’s in trouble, it curls up into a ball, makes its fur spikes stand on end, and then discharges electricity indiscriminately. ## Togedemaru
	It eats snow that piles up on the ground. The more snow it eats, the bigger and more impressive the spikes on its back grow. ## Snom
